# Image-Classification-of-Rock-Paper-Scissors-CNN
This is my final project for dicoding Class submission

Notes:
1. On Google Colabs, Rock-Paper-Scissors Image Classification with Sequential Models Using TensorFlow and Keras Library
2. Rockpaperscissors.zip was downloaded from https://dicodingacademy.blob.core.windows.net/picodiploma/ml pemula academy/rockpaperscissors.zip.
3. utilising the split folder method
3. The collection contains 2,188 photos (rock-paper-scissor), with 726 images of rocks, 712 images of paper, and 750 images of scissors.
4. The dataset is split into two parts: training data (80%), and data validation (the remaining 20%). (20 percent )
5. On Google Colabs, I wrote Python code.
6. TensorFlow and Keras libraries, as well as other libraries, were used to support the computations.
7. Using the Image Augmentation method to create fresh image data that is compatible with the algorithm format
8. Using an Image Data Generator
9. Using a Sequential Model for Data Training
10. Media uploads on Google Colabs are used to classify images.
11. The accuracy rate is greater than 95%.
12. The model developed can anticipate when photographs will be uploaded.
